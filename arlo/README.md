Nature studies offer Finnish students time to engage with nature and to learn about their own environmental impact. Finnish schools adopt a transdisciplinary approach to understanding environmental education, which contrasts with the U.S. approaches, where environmental education is almost solely taught during science courses and touched on only briefly through earth science standards. By un-disciplining environmental education, Finnish citizens have some of the most advanced content knowledge as it relates to climate change, and their policies, cultural practices, and aesthetics reflect that knowledge.

We've adapted the holistic, nature-centered methods we witnessed in the field to create My Nature Study and My Nature Outing, a coding template offering students an opportunity to work with tools to construct meaning in their world. Through this project of languaging and communicating their relationship with the natural environment, students will learn essential computer science concepts and learn to read/edit .html and .css documents.
 
### This template includes responsive design and cool tools like modal views. 

**-Commune with Nature**

**-Use Tools to construct meaning**

**-Scaffold Multimodal Learning**

**-Inform Environmental Policy**

## Get Started (Chromebook)

1.	Go to repository [My Nature Outing repository:] (https://github.com/MyNatureOuting/my-nature-outing) 

2. Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."

3.	Find and open the “my-nature-outing-main-zip” file in “Files/Downloads” and drag this folder into “MyFiles”  

4.	Name this project folder with your first name. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera.

5.	Option A. (Strong Internet) Go to  [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.dev) and open project folder. Option B. (Weak/No Internet) Use **Code Pad Text Editor** to open the index.html document from your project folder. If needed, download Code Pad Text Editor [Code Pad Text Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB)

6.	Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

7.	Once you have modified content and transferred your assets to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes."

8.	Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9.	This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10.	Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.

11. [Share Out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRW9k4l2kyjfKcyVplOtmLul2jltW6PDf1zhpcz7IS5Xur7w/viewform?usp=sf_link)<p>&nbsp;</p>




## Code editor 

You have a range of code editor options depending on your operating system, but we recommend [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.dev) because it works across all operating systems, it comes with HTML preview already installed, and it's free and open-source. If you are working without strong internet, we recommend Code Pad.
